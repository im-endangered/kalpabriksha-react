              <h2>About Kalpabriksha</h2>
              <p>
                First things first, its <b>Kalpabriksha Nepal</b>, not Kalpabrikshya Nepal, not Kalpavriksha Nepal.
                Kalpabriksha Nepal is a youth-led organization established in 2022 and officially registered as an NGO in
                2024. The platform was established by three Nepalese students pursuing higher education in three
                countries with one common goal: Youth upliftment in Nepalese societies. Frustrated by the lack of
                opportunities for visionary youths in the country, Kalpabriksha was initiated as a place where every youth
                talent gets the attention and care it deserves. Many youths still face harassment, abuse, and violence in
                Nepal while many struggle with mental health issues. Kalpabriksha aims to provide support, guidance, and
                opportunities to those youths and help them adjust to day-to-day life.
